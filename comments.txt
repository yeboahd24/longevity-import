I uploaded it together with the database, because it has the records required according to task 4a.

4 variants of events are considered:
- the patient is already in the database, loading data through the form fields;
- the patient is new, loading data through the form fields;
- the patient is already in the database, uploading data via a file;
- the patient is new, uploading data via a file.


Supported file formats: 'xls', 'xlsx', 'xls', 'xls', 'csv', 'pdf', 'odt', 'docx'.


Sample files are stored in the sample_files folder.

Yes, I also had to upload the secret file to the repository.json with a secret key,
because there is no other way to transfer the file.

And some of the libraries required the installation of a Java compiler.
